## Target User

### Primary Persona: "The Seasoned Professional"

- **Who**: 35-55 years old, 10-25 years experience, Senior IC to Director level
- **Income**: $100K-$250K
- **Mindset**: Values authenticity over BS, frustrated with keyword games
- **Challenge**: Complex career story (pivots, freelance, gaps) that templates can't capture

**Pain Points**:
- Traditional resumes don't capture their depth
- ATS-optimized resumes feel fake
- Career pivots are hard to explain
- Most tools optimize for entry-level keyword stuffing
- Age bias concerns

**Jobs to Be Done**:
1. Transform messy career history into compelling narrative
2. Highlight evidence and outcomes, not just titles
3. Tailor story for specific opportunities without lying

### Secondary Personas

| Persona | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Career Pivoter | Changing industries, needs to reframe skills |
| Freelancer | Multiple clients, no linear progression |
| Re-enterer | Returning after break, needs gap-friendly positioning |

### Anti-Personas (NOT Our Users)

- Entry-level mass appliers (need ATS keyword stuffing)
