# AI CV Builder – Gap Analysis & Positioning Plan

This document captures the strategic foundation for an **AI-first, skill-centric career platform**.
It maps market gaps and positions the product clearly against existing competitors.

---

## 1. The Core Market Gap

Most AI-assisted CV and job application tools optimize for **documents**, not **careers**.

### Structural problems across the market:
- Job-by-job tailoring does not scale
- Keyword stuffing mistakes ATS compliance for hiring success
- Static resumes fail to reflect dynamic careers
- Job titles are prioritized over actual skills
- No long-term memory of a user’s career
- Zero recruiter-side intelligence

**Conclusion:**  
The market helps people *apply*, not *progress*.

## 2. Competitor Positioning Map

### Traditional Resume Builders
Examples: Zety, Resume.io, Kickresume  
- Strength: speed and templates  
- Weakness: shallow intelligence  
- Compete on polish, not insight  

**Not a competitive target.**

---

### ATS Optimizers
Examples: Rezi, Jobscan, SkillSyncer  
- Strength: keyword matching  
- Weakness: reactive and narrow  
- Resume remains static  

**Reference tools only, not a direction.**

---

### Job Application Automation
Examples: Simplify, LazyApply, LoopCV  
- Strength: volume  
- Weakness: low signal, reputation risk  

**Avoid – race to the bottom.**

---

### AI Resume Writers
Examples: Enhancv, ResumeAI  
- Strength: language polish  
- Weakness: still document-centric  

**Surface-level competition.**

---

## 3. The White Space

### AI Career Intelligence Platform

Shift from:
> “Create a resume for a job”

To:
> “Maintain a living career model”

This platform becomes the **source of truth** for a user’s professional life.

## 4. Differentiated Pillars

### 1. Skill Graph (Not a Resume)
- Normalize skills from CVs, LinkedIn, GitHub, certificates, projects
- Model relationships between skills
- Track skill depth and recency

---

### 2. Wide Import, Zero Re-entry
- Import PDFs, DOCX, LinkedIn exports, repos
- Resolve duplicates and conflicts automatically
- No manual form filling

---

### 3. Outputs Are Views, Not the Product
Generate:
- Multiple resume formats
- Recruiter summaries
- Skill matrices
- Portfolio narratives

---

### 4. Long-Term Career Memory
- Versioned career history
- Skill growth and decay tracking
- Gap explanations
- Year-over-year change awareness

---

### 5. Intelligence Layer
Answer questions like:
- Am I senior enough for this role?
- What skill blocks my next step?
- Which experience is under-leveraged?

---

## 5. Expansion Strategy

### Phase 1 – Kill Resume Pain
- Radical import
- Best-in-class skill extraction
- Clean exports (PDF, DOCX, LinkedIn-ready)

---

### Phase 2 – Career Guidance Lite
- Skill gap detection
- Role readiness scoring
- Market alignment hints

---

### Phase 3 – Ecosystem Play

- APIs for hiring platforms
- Dashboards for bootcamps and universities

---

## 6. Positioning & Messaging

### Avoid:
- “AI resume builder”
- “ATS optimized CVs”
- “Apply faster”

### Use:
- “Your career, modeled once.”
- “A living skills profile, not a resume.”
- “Stop rewriting. Start progressing.”

## 7. Defensibility

| Threat | Why it holds |
|------|--------------|
| GPT commoditization | Structured career data |
| Big incumbents | No career-history migration |
| Feature copying | Skill graphs + memory are hard |
| Template cloning | Templates are not the product |

---

**Bottom line:**  
This is not a resume builder.  
It is long-term career infrastructure.
