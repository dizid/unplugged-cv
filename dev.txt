Done. Test mode backdoor added. Usage:

http://localhost:3000/?test=test123
This will bypass payment checks and enable all premium features. 
The ?test=test123 parameter stays in the URL as you navigate.

To fully test the paid flow, you'll need to:
Sign up on the live site
Generate a CV
Click "Unlock for $10" → Stripe checkout
Use test card 4242 4242 4242 4242 (if in test mode) or real card (live mode)

1. Paste background → Generate CV
2. Paste job → Analyze Job (inline)
3. Both exist → "Analyze Match" appears in sidebar
4. Match complete → Click "Cover Letter" to generate
5. Toggle between CV and Cover Letter

How It Works
User clicks "Get Premium — $10"
Modal opens with Stripe's embedded checkout form
User completes payment without leaving your site
Modal closes and hasPaid updates to true immediately
Webhook still processes the payment in the background (same as before)
To Test
Run npm run dev and click the premium button to see the embedded checkout modal.

Phase 1: Match Score
API (src/app/api/match-score/route.ts)
Compares CV to parsed job requirements
Returns: score (0-100), skill matches with evidence, gaps, seniority fit,
 talking points
Component (src/components/MatchScore.tsx)
Lives in ActionPanel sidebar
Shows "Analyze Match" button when job is parsed
Expandable score badge with details
Phase 2: Cover Letter
API (src/app/api/generate-cover-letter/route.ts)
Generates evidence-based cover letter using CV + job + match insights
Streams response for real-time display
No "Dear Hiring Manager" boilerplate - company-specific, evidence-based
Toggle (updated src/app/page.tsx)
Simple CV ↔ Cover Letter toggle in output view
Clicking "Cover Letter" generates on first click, then switches
Same copy/export actions work for both
