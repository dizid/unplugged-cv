# AI CV Builder – Killer Product Plan

## Core Principle
The user never needs to know how to write a CV. They only describe who they are. AI decides and executes everything else.

## 1. Wide Import (Foundational)
Users can upload or input anything:
- Existing CVs (PDF, Word)
- LinkedIn profiles
- Portfolio URLs
- Old cover letters
- Performance reviews
- Plain text notes
- Voice input

AI automatically:
- Deduplicates content
- Normalizes roles, dates, skills
- Extracts achievements
- Infers seniority and career trajectory

## 2. Career Intelligence Engine
AI understands:
- Skill clusters (not keywords)
- Transferable skills

No manual role or job selection required.

---

## 3. Tone Control (Simple)
Single global tone selector:
- Neutral / Professional
- Confident

Tone is applied consistently across the entire CV.
